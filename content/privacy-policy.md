This site does not collect any personal information or make use of any tracking or non-essential cookies.

The only data I'm collecting is anonymous browsing data for analytics using [Ackee](https://github.com/electerious/Ackee), which is an open-source and privacy respecting alternative to Google Analytics.
I'm using a self-hosted version so no data is shared with third-parties.
