My name is Jim Saari and I'm an experienced full stack web developer living in Turku, Finland. Coding is my passion and I'm always striving to improve my craft and learn new things.

I have over {{< duration 2017 >}} years of experience working on exciting and innovative projects, independently and in teams, leveraging the power of modern JavaScript to build responsive and dynamic applications that clients love.
