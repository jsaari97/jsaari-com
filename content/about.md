My name is **Jim Saari** and I'm an young experienced web developer
based in Kronoby, Finland. Coding is my passion and I'm always striving to
improve my craft.

I have over three years of experience working on exciting and innovative
projects, independently or in teams, leveraging the power of modern
JavaScript to build responsive and dynamic applications that clients love.
