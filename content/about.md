My name is Jim Saari and I'm an young experienced full stack web developer
living in Vaasa, Finland. Coding is my passion and I'm always striving to
improve my craft and learn new things.

I have over four years of experience working on exciting and innovative
projects, independently and in teams, leveraging the power of modern
JavaScript to build responsive and dynamic applications that clients love.
